# Sudoku solver

This is a simple practice project to learn domain modeling. 

Contains a couple of different types of resolvers which can solve most of the sudoku boards. Only such boards which need to be solved by trying different possible numbers to cells cannot be solved at the moment.

## Run unit tests

`mvn test`
